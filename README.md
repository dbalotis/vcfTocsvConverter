# VCF To CSV Converter
A simple tool that converts a vcf file, taken from the phone contacts, to a csv fie that can be imported in any spreadsheet.

The reason I created this is because I couldn't find any solution that does this offline without any constraints. Most tools either expected me to upload to them all my contacts (?!?), or the offline ones expected a payment if it was to convert more that 50 contacts (who has less that 50 nowadays?).
I am open to any contributions and suggestions to this very simple tool.
I will also accept any polite constructive criticism with suggestions for improvement.

I hope it saves you some time and privacy!

## Use of the tool.
Run it and select the input vcf file as well as the export csv file, and hit convert. Pretty self explanatory :D
